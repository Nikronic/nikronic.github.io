School-of-AI is an <strong>free and open community</strong> which works toward the <strong>goal of introducing AI to a broader range of audience with diverse background</strong> that can be incorporated in all other fields of technology and science. Our audience includes mostly non-computer-science students that want to know more about the revolution of AI and seek to show the appropriate way of reaching it by relying on MOOCs.

    <li>Mentoring students, particularly those with non-STEM background toward utilizing AI in other fields of science</li>
</ul>
