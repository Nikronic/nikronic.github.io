This project pertains automated Descreening process. Descreening is the task that we try to reconstruct the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halftone">halftoned</a> image (which is the mandatory process to interact images with printers, scanners, monitors, etc) meanwhile reducing the amount of data loss. For more info, please see the <a href="https://doi.org/10.1145/3197517.3201377">original paper</a>.

<ul>
    <li>First and the only fully open source implementation of this paper, in PyTorch</li>
    <li>The implementation can be divided into below separate projects:</li>
