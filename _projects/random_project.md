This section contains small projects I did as part of my studies or free time, but not large enough be considered focusing that much! These projects cover different topics, such as Computer-aided-design to Statistical NLP for news classification.

<ul>
    <li>Abstract level machine learning models via Sklearn (<a href="https://github.com/Nikronic/Machine-Learning-Models">Github</a>)</li>
    <li>Different CAD modules in VHDL (<a href="https://github.com/Nikronic/CAD_2018">Github</a>) and circuits in HSpice (<a href="https://github.com/Nikronic/Microelectronic-Circuits">Github</a>)</li>
    <li>Statistical NLP model for Persian news classification (<a href="https://github.com/Nikronic/NLP-Fall18-UOG">Github</a>)</li>
    <li>Ping-pong game on Xilinx FPGA via VHDL and physical input modules (<a href="https://github.com/hamed-faraji/CAD-Simplified-Ping-Pong-Game">Github</a>)</li>
</ul>
