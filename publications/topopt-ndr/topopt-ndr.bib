abstract = { Structural topology optimization seeks to distribute material throughout a design
domain in a way that maximizes a certain performance goal. In this work, we solve
the topology optimization problem by parameterizing the designs via recently introduced
coordinate-based neural networks. Specifically, we show that networks with Fourier
feature mapping can achieve state-of-the-art performance. Our method enables the realization
of a range of designs using a single mesh via tuning the frequency content of the
solutions independently of the finite element discretization grid. This frequency
control offers attractive properties, such as mesh-independent results and sub-pixel
filtering that leads to appropriate designs for upsampling. We demonstrate our method
on the compliance minimization problem, optimizing for the stiffest possible structure
within a weight budget for a prescribed set of loads.},
