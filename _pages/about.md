I hold a Master's degree in Computer Engineering from the Iran University of Science and Technology (IUST) and currently work as a machine learning engineer, specializing in the development of data-driven decision-making systems for business optimization. Previously, I completed a research internship with the Artificial Intelligence Aided Design and Manufacturing (<a href="https://aidam.mpi-inf.mpg.de/">AIDAM</a>) group at the Max Planck Institute for Informatics (<a href="https://www.mpi-inf.mpg.de/home/">MPI-INF</a>). During my time there, I focused on Computational Fabrication, specificially, Physics-Informed Deep Learning for Structurla Optimization under the supervision of <a href="https://aidam.mpi-inf.mpg.de/?view=people_vahid">Dr. Vahid Babaei</a>, the AIDAM group leader, and in collaboration with <a href="https://julianpanetta.com/">Prof. Julian Panetta</a>, an Assistant Professor at the University of California, Davis. This opportunity allowed me to realize the importance and applicability of AI in conjunction with science & engineering, and highlighted the exciting possibilities of interdisciplinary research. Before this, my work centered around classical digital image processing, deep computer vision, and data science.

Enough with the clichés—I don’t talk like that, but for some reason, it’s considered the ‘professional’ format, which I don’t even think is real. I’m going to rewrite everything to be closer to how I actually think, because I believe originality and authenticity lie there. Any filtering process just makes it worse. (haven't done it yet anywhere except my personal blog which is private for now.)

In my spare time, I play video games, read about history, and I like standup comedy. I'm also passionate about open-source projects and consider GitHub my primary social media platform.

Currently, I am actively seeking an exceptional PhD opportunity where I can further explore and contribute to the field of artificial intelligence, particularly in areas that intersect with science and engineering.
