I'm a First-year PhD student at Aalto University working under supervision of Prof. Jan Akmal in <a href="https://www.aalto.fi/en/department-of-energy-and-mechanical-engineering/materials-to-products">Material2Products</a> group, focusing on AI-assisted Product Development, mainly integration of data-driven and physics-based deep learning in advanced manufacturing processes. I'm specially excited about DL/ML, Computational Design, Fabrication, Drug Design and Health, and applicability of AI in conjunction with science & engineering.

Before this, I worked as a machine learning engineer, building decision-making systems for business optimization. I also had a chance to join the Artificial Intelligence Aided Design and Manufacturing (<a href="https://aidam.mpi-inf.mpg.de/">AIDAM</a>) group at the Max Planck Institute for Informatics (<a href="https://www.mpi-inf.mpg.de/home/">MPI-INF</a>) as an research intern, doing my master's thesis. During my time there, I focused on Computational Fabrication, specifically, Physics-Informed Deep Learning for Structural Optimization under the supervision of <a href="https://aidam.mpi-inf.mpg.de/?view=people_vahid">Dr. Vahid Babaei</a>, the AIDAM group leader, and in collaboration with <a href="https://julianpanetta.com/">Prof. Julian Panetta</a>, an Assistant Professor at the University of California, Davis. Before this, my work centered around classical digital image processing, deep computer vision, and data science.

In my spare time, I play video games, read about history, and I like standup comedy. I'm also passionate about open-source projects and consider GitHub my primary social media platform.

I'm always open to collaborate and having a discussion around research, from ideation to dissemination, industry challenges, and even setting up a local server to play Factorio/DoTA2/CS2 and so on!
