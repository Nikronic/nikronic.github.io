## Remark
*You might ask why on earth someone decides to give star to a personal website that is literally the template itself*.

Well, prior to the current website (which is based on the amazing `folio` template), it was based on `colorlib` template ([source code](https://github.com/nikronic/colorlib-template), [deployed website (considered the OLD website)](https://www.nikronic.com/colorlib-template/)) and had many customizations and was re-written to target `jekyll` for better customization. After getting more experience, I learned that it was too distracting, so I adopted the `folio` theme.
